<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Poppy, I graduated from a coding bootcamp in May 2024, and am now taking a course on Udemy to further my skills. Open to web developer roles.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I enjoy collecting albums, watching TV, and singing. My favorite movie is Coraline, and my favorite TV show is Alice In Borderland. I also listen to music a lot, my favorite group is BTS but I listen to many different artists. My playlist is actually 553 songs long. </p>

<p>My dream is to create a website for photocard collectors, where they can collect digital photocards. Not like NFTs because that's dumb. But collecting is so expensive, and I want to make it more accessible to everyone. But obviously just drawing unlimited photocards would be boring. So I want to connect the app to the user's Spotify/Apple Music, and every time they stream a song they get one "dollar" (app currency). And every 5-10 dollars or so, they could pull a digital photocard and have a collection. This way you are still incentivized to support the artist through streams, and you still get the excitement of a random photocard pull without spending $25-$30.</p>
