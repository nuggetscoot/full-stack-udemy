        <h2>Otherside Picnic</h2>
        <div class="container">
          <div>
            <p>I did like the plot, but there was barely any yuri. I guess it was implied at the end, but I thought it would've been more prevalent based on the cover art. I heard they are canon in the manga though which raises the score a little bit. It's one of the only ones on the list with a horror-like plot, so I think it's a good starting place for people who like horror.</p>

    <h2>I'm In Love With The Villainess</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div>
            <p>I can understand why people like it. I thought it was cute and pretty funny. I really don't understand why they chose to add incest, it literally added nothing to the plot. That's the only thing that threw me off about it, it was good besides that. I did like the premise of there being a bunch of boys for her to choose from, but she chose the girl that bullies her. Also apparently one of the characters is revealed as trans in the manga which I thought was cool since there usually isn't a lot of trans represation in yuri.</p>

<h2>Sweet Blue Flowers</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div>
        <p>The art style is super cute. It's the first one on the list with an actual kiss, but it's not between the two main girls. It was definitely a cute story, but as someone who prefers watching shows with action, I found it a little boring. If you're someone who just wants a cute story of girls coming to terms with their sexuality, you'll probably like this.</p>

<h2>Stardust Telepath</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div>
    <p>So incredibly cute. Akeuchi is super autistic coded, which I really appreciated. While they are never confirmed to be canon, they almost kiss multiple times and it's very heavily implied that Umika has a crush on Akeuchi. Also surprisingly funny, it made me laugh out loud a few times. The ending did feel a little rushed, but I enjoyed it overall.</p>

<h2>Adachi And Shimamura</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div>
<p>I feel like this one is a classic. I have the same problem as I had with Sweet Blue Flowers, where I just found it a little boring because there was so action. But it was by no means bad, I still enjoyed watching it for the most part. I don't understand why people call this yuri bait. They don't really get together at the end, but it's made explicitly clear that Adachi is in love with Shimamura. I agree with most people that the ending was unsatisfying, but they get together in the light novel which makes it better.</p>

<h2>The Many Sides Of Voice Actor Radio</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div>
<p>Speaking of yuri bait, this one fits the bill for me. It had so much potential in the beginning. I loved their dynamic of rivals who have to pretend to like each other, I just wish they went through with it at the end and actually made them canon. There is a little bit of subtext, but they basically admitted at the end that it was all bait. Also the fanservice at the beginning made me very uncomfortable because they're high schoolers, but it calmed down about halfway through.</p>

<h2>Konohana Kitan</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div>
<p>Went into this prepared for a super cute story with not much action, but it was honestly a lot darker than I thought it was going to be. It touches on death quite a bit, which it makes sense why later in the show. The yuri in this one is definitely more subtext, there is some romantic tension and it's implied that Ren has a crush on Natsume, but nothing is ever confirmed to be canon. It is still very cute despite the darker theme, one thing I really liked was that the charcter's chibi version were just round cats.</p>

<h2>The Magical Revolution Of The Reincarnated Princess And The Genius Young Lady</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div>
<p>One of my favorites on the list. There is a lot of action and angst, but it still managed to be funny at times. The action scenes are very well animated and fun to watch, I never found myself getting bored. Their dynamic is very cute, and they are actually canon. This is the first one on the list with a kiss between the main characters, and it was done very well.</p>

<h2>Izetta The Last Witch</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div>
<p>I was split on this at first. It has a really good soundtrack, that was probably the best thing about it. Izetta and Fine had a very cute relationship as well. It has a good plot with good action, but there is a lot of fanservice surrounding Izetta. This was pretty annoying, but I was under the impression that she was an adult so it didn't bother me too much. Then in one of the last episodes, they mention that she is fifteen. FIFTEEN???? That really made me uncomfortable and the fact that they didn't mention it until the very end makes it worse. If it weren't for that, I would've ranked it a lot higher.</p>

<h2>Inugami-San to Nekoyama-San</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div>
<p>This was a super short show, and not very memorable. Since it was so short, there wasn't really a plot and was mainly just one-shots. Their dynamic was super cute, I would love to see a full show with them. Since it was so short I can't say I wouldn't recommend it, but it is pretty forgettable.</p>

<h2>Birdie Wing</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div>
<p>I was hesitant to watch this at first, since I am a certified golf hater. But it was honestly super interesting. It goes more into the illegal mafia side of golf (which I feel like doesn't exist in real life but it's a cool concept). The yuri is more subtext, they definitely flirt from time to time but nothing is ever canon. It's definitely worth the watch even if it's not super yuri, it even made me think golf can be kinda cool sometimes. Also had an insanely catchy opening song, probably my favorite on the whole list.</p>

<h2>If My Favorite Pop Idol Made It To The Budokan, I Would Die</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div>
<p>This one is so funny. As a fangirl, I found a lot of this show relatable. The yuri is super prevalent, not only between the two main characters but also between two side characters. The art style is also incredibly pretty, which you might not expect considering the comedic genre of the show, but it actually works really well. The only complaint I have is the ending left a lot unresolved. I would love a season 2 to wrap everything up.</p>

<h2>Vampire In The Garden</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div>
<p>I'm split on this one. Since it is between a vampire and a human, there's bound to be an age gap, but the human, Momo's age, is unknown. While watching this show, I loved it because I was under the impression that Momo was an adult since she was in the military and they never mentioned she was a child. But after some research, apparently there is a chance she could be 14. I can't find any proof of that since I don't remember them saying that in the show, but if that's the case, that makes it an automatic 0/10 for me. But if Momo is an adult, I would give this a 9/10 because it is very well written and tragic. If you ever want to know what doomed yuri is, watch this show.</p>

<h2>Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch From Mercury</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div>
<p>I really enjoyed watching this one. I never got the hype of Gundam before, but I kind of get it now. The plot was good with lots of action, and it was actually a lot darker than I thought it would be. That being said, the yuri is kind of put on the backburner. Miorine and Suletta are canonically engaged, but it isn't brought up very often. I just wished it focused a little more on their relationship, but I still thought it was a good watch. There was also lots of diversity which I appreciated.</p>

<h2>BanG Dream! It's My Go!!!!!</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div>
<p>Maybe I'm a bit biased because I already loved the BanG Dream franchise, but I loved this. As an anime so heavily revolved around music, of course the music has to be good. But I feel like they go above and beyond in making quality music. The characters are so well written and fleshed out. Even though the plot may seem a bit dramatized at times, the characters always feel so human. I really really really like Tomori's character, it's very rare that you'll see a character actually portrayed as autistic in anime. The yuri is definitely more subtext, but it just leaves so much room for shipping because all of the characters have some type of chemistry. The one thing I didn't really like was the animation style, but it wasn't so bad that it ruined the whole show for me.</p>

<h2>Liz And The Blue Bird</h2>
<p>I could see it being misconstrued as a friendship, but I thought it was a super cute unrequited love story</p>

<h2>Mysteria Friends</h2>
<p>Really dissapointed bc I loved their dynamic so much, but there was too much fanservice and barely a plot. Would love to see an actual full-fledged anime with them</p>

<h2>Strawberry Panic</h2>
