<h1>Poppy Yuri Ranking</h1>
<h2>Oh the yuri of it all</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Otherside Picnic</h3>
<p>Good plot but not enough yuri</p>

<h3>I'm In Love With The Villainess</h3>
<p>Not sure what the point of the incest was but pretty decent plot and yuri</p>

<h3>Sweet Blue Flowers</h3>
<p>A little boring but at least there's a kiss</p>

<h3>Stardust Telepath</h3>
<p>Super cute I love autistic lesbians</p>

<h3>Adachi And Shimamura</h3>
<p>A little forgettable but still cute and had good yuri. It will never be the yuri bait people claim for it to be</p>

<h3>The Many Sides Of Voice Actor Radio</h3>
<p>Kinda yuri bait, they had good chemistry I just wish they actually went through with it</p>

<h3>Konohana Kitan</h3>
<p>Surprisingly dark, pretty good but could use more yuri</p>

<h3>The Magical Revolution Of The Reincarnated Princess And The Genius</h3>
<p>So good had angst, humor, action, and an actual kiss</p>

<h3>Izetta The Last Witch</h3>
<p>Good action and soundtrack but the fanservice was out of control</p>

<h3>Inugami-San to Nekoyama-San</h3>
<p>Pretty forgettable but cute I guess</p>

<h3>Birdie Wing</h3>
<p>As a golf hater, this was actually way better than expected, could have used a little more yuri but it's pretty heavily implied</p>

<h3>If My Favorite Pop Idol Made It To The Budokan, I Would Die</h3>
<p>Super funny and relatable, yuri super prevalent but the ending left a lot unresolved</p>

<h3>Vampire In The Garden</h3>
<p>Literally the definition of doomed yuri I almost cried</p>

<h3>Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch From Mercury</h3>
<p>I guess they're technically canon but I really didn't consider this yuri, good plot though</p>

<h3>BanG Dream It's My Go!!!</h3>
<p>Idk why but this was one of my favorites, I love autistic lesbians</p>

<h3>Lycoris Recoil</h3>
<p>Good action and some yuri subtext, it just didn't stand out to me</p>

<h3>Asteroid In Love</h3>
<p>Literally the defintion of yuri fluff, just so cute and also Ao trans and Suzu is so me</p>
<h3>Liz And The Blue Bird</h3>
<p>I could see it being misconstrued as a friendship, but I thought it was a super cute unrequited love story</p>

<h3>Mysteria Friends</h3>
<p>Really dissapointed bc I loved their dynamic so much, but there was too much fanservice and barely a plot. Would love to see an actual full-fledged anime with them</p>

<h3>Strawberry Panic</h3>
<p>Sometimes written like a bad fanfiction but I think that's part of the charm of it</p>
