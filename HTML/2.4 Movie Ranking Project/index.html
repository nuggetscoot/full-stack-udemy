        <h2>Otherside Picnic</h2>
        <div class="container">
          <div>
            <p>I did like the plot, but there was barely any yuri. I guess it was implied at the end, but I thought it would've been more prevalent based on the cover art. I heard they are canon in the manga though which raises the score a little bit.</p>
            <h3>Score: 8/10</h3>

    <h2>I'm In Love With The Villainess</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div>
            <p>I can understand why people like it. I thought it was cute and pretty funny. I really don't understand why they chose to add incest, it literally added nothing to the plot. That's the only thing that threw me off about it, it was good besides that. I did like the premise of there being a bunch of boys for her to choose from, but she chose the girl that bullies her.</p>
            <h3>Score: 7.5/10</h3>

<h2>Sweet Blue Flowers</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div>
        <p>The art style is super cute. It's the first one on the list with an actual kiss, but it's not between the two main girls. It was definitely a cute story, but as someone who prefers watching shows with action, I found it a little boring. If you're someone who just wants a cute story of girls coming to terms with their sexuality, you'll probably like this.</p>
        <h3>Score: 8/10</h3>

<h2>Stardust Telepath</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div>
    <p>So incredibly cute. Akeuchi is super autistic coded, which I really appreciated. While they are never confirmed to be canon, they almost kiss multiple times and it's very heavily implied that Umika has a crush on Akeuchi. Also surprisingly funny, it made me laugh out loud a few times. The ending did feel a little rushed, but I enjoyed it overall.</p>
    <h3>Score: 9/10</h3>

<h2>Adachi And Shimamura</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div>
<p>I feel like this one is a classic. I have the same problem as I had with Sweet Blue Flowers, where I just found it a little boring because there was so action. But it was by no means bad, I still enjoyed watching it for the most part. I don't understand why people call this yuri bait. They don't really get together at the end, but it's made explicitly clear that Adachi is in love with Shimamura. I agree with most people that the ending was unsatisfying, but they get together in the light novel which makes it better.</p>
<h3>Score: 8/10</h3>

<h2>The Many Sides Of Voice Actor Radio</h2>
<div class="container">
    <div>
<p>Speaking of yuri bait, this one fits the bill for me. It had so much potential in the beginning. I loved their dynamic of rivals who have to pretend to like each other, I just wish they went through with it at the end and actually made them canon. There is a little bit of subtext, but they basically admitted at the end that it was all bait. Also the fanservice at the beginning made me very uncomfortable because they're high schoolers, but it calmed down about halfway through.</p>
<h3>Score: 6/10</h3>

<div class="background-2">
<h2>Konohana Kitan</h2>
<p>Surprisingly dark, pretty good but could use more yuri</p>
</div>

<div >
<h2>The Magical Revolution Of The Reincarnated Princess And The Genius</h2>
<p>So good had angst, humor, action, and an actual kiss</p>
</div>

<div class="background-3">
<h2>Izetta The Last Witch</h2>
<p>Good action and soundtrack but the fanservice was out of control</p>
</div>

<div class="background-4">
<h2>Inugami-San to Nekoyama-San</h2>
<p>Pretty forgettable but cute I guess</p>
</div>

<div class="background-1">
<h2>Birdie Wing</h2>
<p>As a golf hater, this was actually way better than expected, could have used a little more yuri but it's pretty heavily implied</p>
</div>

<div class="background-2">
<h2>If My Favorite Pop Idol Made It To The Budokan, I Would Die</h2>
<p>Super funny and relatable, yuri super prevalent but the ending left a lot unresolved</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Vampire In The Garden</h2>
<p>Literally the definition of doomed yuri I almost cried</p>
</div>

<div class="background-3">
<h2>Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch From Mercury</h2>
<p>I guess they're technically canon but it barely focused on their relationship so I'm a little hesitant to call it yuri, the plot was good though</p>
</div>

<div class="background-4">
<h2>BanG Dream It's My Go!!!</h2>
<p>Idk why but this was one of my favorites, I love autistic lesbians</p>
</div>

<div class="background-1">
<h2>Lycoris Recoil</h2>
<p>Good action and some yuri subtext, it just didn't stand out to me</p>
</div>

<div class="background-2">
<h2>Asteroid In Love</h2>
<p>Literally the defintion of yuri fluff, just so cute and also Ao trans and Suzu is so me</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Liz And The Blue Bird</h2>
<p>I could see it being misconstrued as a friendship, but I thought it was a super cute unrequited love story</p>
</div>

<div class="background-3">
<h2>Mysteria Friends</h2>
<p>Really dissapointed bc I loved their dynamic so much, but there was too much fanservice and barely a plot. Would love to see an actual full-fledged anime with them</p>
</div>

<div class="background-4">
<h2>Strawberry Panic</h2>
<p>Sometimes written like a bad fanfiction but I think that's part of the charm of it</p>
