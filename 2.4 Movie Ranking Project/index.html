<h1>Poppy Yuri Ranking</h1>
<h2>Oh the yuri of it all</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Otherside Picnic</h3>
<p>Good plot but not enough yuri</p>

<h3>I'm In Love With The Villainess</h3>
<p>Not sure what the point of the incest was but pretty decent plot and yuri</p>

<h3>Sweet Blue Flowers</h3>
<p>A little boring but at least there's a kiss</p>

<h3>Stardust Telepath</h3>
<p>Super cute I love autistic lesbians</p>

<h3>The Many Sides Of Voice Actor Radio</h3>
<p>They need to calm down with the sexualization but it has potential</p>

<h3>Konohana Kitan</h3>
<p>Surprisingly dark, pretty good but could use more yuri</p>

<h3>The Magical Revolution Of The Reincarnated Princess And The Genius</h3>
<p>Only halfway through but my favorite so far, has action, angst, and an actual kiss</p>
